# TaxCalculator

Create a library that given employee annual salary details outputs a monthly pay slip.


Attributes of the employee are:

• name
• annual salary


Attributes of the monthly pay slip are:

• name
• gross monthly income = annual salary / 12 (months)
• monthly income tax = (annual tax rate as provided below) / 12
(months)
• net monthly income = gross monthly income - income tax


The following annual tax rates apply:

Taxable income | Tax on this income

$0 - $20,000 | $0

$20,001 - $40,000 | 10c for each $1 over $20,000

$40,001 - $80,000 | 20c for each $1 over $40,000

$80,001 - $180,000 | 30c for each $1 over $80,000

$180,001 and over | 40c for each $1 over $180,000


For example, for an employee with an annual salary of $60,000:

- gross monthly income
= 60,000 / 12 = 5,000
- monthly income tax
= ((20,000 * 0) + ((40,000 - 20,000) * 0.1) + ((60,000 - 40,000) * 0.2))
/ 12
= (0 + (20,000 * 0.1) + (20,000 * 0.2)) / 12
= (0 + 2,000 + 4,000) / 12
= 500
- net monthly income
= 5,000 – 500 = 4,500

Here is example input:

"Mary Song" 60000

and exmaple of what the calculations are:

Monthly Payslip for: "Mary Song"
Gross Monthly Income: $5000
Monthly Income Tax: $500
Net Monthly Income: $4500
